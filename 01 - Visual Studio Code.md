# Setting up the text editor

By now, you should have all the necesary packages installed in your computer. The next step is to set up our environment for writting the paper.

You could use any text editor to write your research paper, but in our case we are going to use Visual Studio Code.

## Visual Studio Code

VSC is a boiled down version of Visual Studio that is perfect for writing simple Python and C# scripts, but also amazingly good at Markdown syntax.

Other **VERY** good text editors are *SublimeText* and *Atom*, they all have a very similar design and behaviour; and you will find most of the functionality can be extended to your needs via packages/extensions, no matter the text editor you choose.

We will also be making heavy use of VSC's extensions. You can install them directly from visual studio by pressing `CMD+SHIFT+X` on Mac or `CTRL+SHIFT+X` on Windows.

Search and install the following extensions:

* **Markdown All In One** - by Yu Zhang
* **Markdown Footnotes** - by Matt Bierner
* **Markdown Preview Enhanced** - by Yiyi Wang
* **markdownlint** - by David Anson
* **Python** - by Microsoft (this one might come pre-installed)
* **RainbowCSV** - by mechatroner (CSV colouring)
* **vscode-pandoc** - by DougFinke (Research Paper PDF rendering through VSC)
* **vscode-pdf** - by tomoki1207 (Visualize PDF without leaving VSC)
