So far, we have only covered how to export to `pdf` format with the default template used by Pandoc: the **Article Class**. In this chapter we will:

    * Explore some of it's posibilities and problems of the Article Class
    * Find out how to change your Latex Template
    * Introduce to a new class: the **Elsarticle Class**
    * Export our research paper as .docx and learn about MSWord Pandoc templates
    * Export our research paper as .html, to publish on a website, and what templates can be used.

> The Article class is a default latex document class that covers a wide range of options. You can find all the details at the [CTAN Website](https://ctan.org/pkg/article?lang=en).
